### About me 🧿

I started out as a maths enthusiast. Then I discovered coding and found it to be a whole new way of solving problems, by applying the logic I learned from maths and transforming it into dynamic, real-world solutions.

### Languages and softwares 🐍

- **R programming**: Proficient, regularly use R for data analysis and visualisation. I’m comfortable applying it to a wide range of tasks and continue to leverage it in my current projects, including automation tasks.
- **R Shiny**: Regularly using R Shiny to build an interactive web app collaboratively.
- **Python programming**: Experienced, have used Python extensively for machine learning, data processing, and automation tasks.

### Current project 🧵

**Pharmaverse/aNCA**: Contributing to the development and maintenance of the aNCA package, which is used for non-compartmental analysis in pharmacokinetics.
